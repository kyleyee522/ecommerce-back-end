# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description

- This project allows the user to interact with the API routes for this e-commerce project. To initialize the project, the user must first run the command "npm i" to install all the dependencies. Next, the user must initialize the database. If they have PostgreSQL installed, then they must run the command "psql -U postgres" then "\i db/schema.sql". Then the user must add data to the databse by running the command "npm run seed". If the user has Insomnia installed, the can use Insomnia to interact with the API routes. The route URLs are: http://localhost:3001/api/products, http://localhost:3001/api/categories, http://localhost:3001/api/tags. The user will be able to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

- This project was created to practice creating API routes and HTTP methods. The package that was used to create the models is the Node package "sequelize".
